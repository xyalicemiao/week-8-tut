  The Special Virtual Issue on Nonresponse Rates and Nonresponse Adjustments, curated by Kristen Olson and Katherine Jenny Thompson, explores declining response rates across survey modes, the effectiveness of auxiliary variables in addressing nonresponse bias, and various nonresponse adjustment strategies. It includes studies highlighting the industry-wide trend of falling response rates, the utility of predictive auxiliary variables in remediation efforts, and the evaluation of adjustment methods like calibration weighting, imputation, and propensity-score weighting. The issue stresses the importance of understanding survey response mechanisms for effective bias mitigation.
The collection delves into the intricacies of survey methodology, specifically the challenge of nonresponse in various data collection modes. It underscores a notable trend: declining response rates across all survey modes, a concern for survey methodologists due to its potential to introduce bias into survey estimates. The issue compiles research demonstrating this decline, regardless of the mode of data collection, from traditional face-to-face interviews to web-based surveys.
A major concern that has been highlighted is the impact of these declining rates on the representativeness and accuracy of the study results. Papers in the field examine the causes and consequences of non-response, and the effectiveness of various management strategies These strategies include statistical adjustments such as weights and measures tax, with a focus on using supportive resources to reduce non-response bias.
Importantly, the issue not only reviews existing approaches but also proposes new methodologies for improving response rates and adjusting for nonresponse. This includes the development of theory-driven models to predict nonresponse and the exploration of adaptive survey designs that adjust to respondent behavior in real-time.
In essence, this special issue highlights the ongoing challenges and innovative solutions in survey methodology related to nonresponse. It emphasizes the need for continuous research to better understand and address the complexities of nonresponse, ensuring that surveys remain a reliable source of data for decision-making and research.
In terms of the issue of declining in response rate in surveys, the paper ‘Where Have the Respondents Gone? Perhaps We Ate Them All’ by Thomas J Leeper also discusses the urgent issue of declining response rates in survey research, proposing a paradigm shift in understanding nonresponse. Instead of viewing it merely as an individual, survey-specific issue, it suggests conceptualizing nonresponse as a ‘common pool resource dilemma’. This perspective highlights the collective challenge facing researchers in managing the respondent pool without overextraction, urging a broader, cross-level approach to study and mitigate nonresponse by viewing human responses as a shared resource. The paper uses the United States as a case study to explore this concept and suggest future research directions.
According to this scholarly article by Bereau of Labor Statistics of the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has adapted its survey methods in response to declining participation rates, incorporating innovative approaches like video data collection and web scraping. This evolution ensures the reliability of its data amidst changing societal and work patterns, especially highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic's impact. BLS's efforts in expanding sample sizes and integrating alternative data sources exemplify their commitment to maintaining high-quality statistical outputs, critical for informed decision-making.
